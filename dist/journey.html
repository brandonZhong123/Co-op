        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">My experience</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">At the start of my placement, I assisted my supervisor with a WordPress project, tweaking and updating a website for about a week and a half. After that, I began the DJ Event Planner project. My initial tasks involved researching existing DJ planners like VIBO and Cue to understand their functionality. Once my research was complete, I set up the project, selected a template, and organized my files for local development.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">What to expect/Early stages </h3>
        <p class="mt-2">In the early stages of your placement, you should expect to start coding in your preferred stream right away. In the beginning, you will run into several problems setting up your project. A good piece of advice is to ask your supervisor many questions in the early stages so you won’t run into any problems in the future.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold"> My experience </h3>
        <p class="mt-2">Midway through the semester, I focused on implementing features for the DJ Event Planner. I took a step-by-step approach, adding new features weekly. For example, during the first week, I developed a role-based hierarchy system that assigned permissions to users based on their roles. I then moved on to designing and building the dashboard.</p>

      <div class="mt-8 bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">What to expect </h3>
        <p class="mt-2">By the mid-stage of development, hopefully, you will have developed a good workflow, and developing features should become more efficient. At this stage, when debugging, I would suggest checking forums for people who have encountered similar issues, especially if your supervisor is unavailable.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">By the end of the semester, I had implemented several features in the app. While I wasn’t expected to complete the entire project, my work established a solid foundation for future co-op students to build upon, adding new features and refining the codebase.</p>
