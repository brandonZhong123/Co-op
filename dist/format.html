I’ll share everything from the skills I developed before starting my placement to the daily tasks I performed and my key takeaways.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">What Did I Do?</h3>
            <p class="mt-2">At Digitera, I spent most of the semester designing a demo DJ Event Planner from scratch using the Laravel framework. I worked as a full-stack developer, primarily focusing on backend development with PHP. My co-op placement was entirely virtual, allowing me to work remotely from home or school.</p>

            <p class="mt-2">In late May, I expressed interest in being placed at Digitera for the upcoming school year. Digitera required candidates to showcase a personal summer project as proof of their skills and readiness for the role. To meet this requirement, I developed a project using the Laravel framework over the summer, which helped secure my placement.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Laravel Project</h3>
            <p class="mt-2">I created an e-commerce store using the Laravel framework. The app allowed users to place orders and post products they wanted to sell. It featured a functional database for users, orders, shippers, and products. Completing this project in about two months was instrumental in securing my placement at Digitera.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Early Placement</h3>
            <p class="mt-2">At the start of my placement, I assisted my supervisor with a WordPress project, tweaking and updating a website for about a week and a half. After that, I began the DJ Event Planner project. My initial tasks involved researching existing DJ planners like VIBO and Cue to understand their functionality. Once my research was complete, I set up the project, selected a template, and organized my files for local development.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Mid-Semester</h3>
            <p class="mt-2">Midway through the semester, I focused on implementing features for the DJ Event Planner. I took a step-by-step approach, adding new features weekly. For example, during the first week, I developed a role-based hierarchy system that assigned permissions to users based on their roles. I then moved on to designing and building the dashboard.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">End of Placement</h3>
            <p class="mt-2">By the end of the semester, I had implemented several features in the app. While I wasn’t expected to complete the entire project, my work established a solid foundation for future co-op students to build upon, adding new features and refining the codebase.</p>
