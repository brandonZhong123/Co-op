          <p class="mt-2">My name is Brandon Zhong, and this page covers my journey as a Junior Developer at Digitera. Iâ€™ll share everything from the skills I developed before starting my placement to the daily tasks I performed and my key takeaways. This reflection encompasses my experiences from the summer before the placement to the near end of the semester. </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">What Did I Do?</h3>
          <p class="mt-2">At Digitera, I spent most of the semester designing a demo DJ Event Planner from scratch using the Laravel framework. I worked as a full-stack developer, primarily focusing on backend development with PHP. My co-op placement was entirely virtual, allowing me to work remotely from home or school.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">About Digitera</h3>
            <p class="mt-2">Digitera is a software company that as of now, primarily focusses on an app called Prom Planner. Prom planner is a collection of tools that can be used by prom comities to keep prom much more organized. The way the their co-op system works is dividing you into different streams depending on your expertise. I was personally in the full-stack php stream so depending on what stream you are working in, you might do something different from me. At your co-op placement depending on how long ago you are reading this you are most likley going to be developing something related to prom planner. </p>
