            Employability: My first goal was to improve self-regulation and focus during my online co-op placement. To minimize distractions, I used a structured schedule, productivity tools, aiming to reduce distractions by 50% within four weeks.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2"> Placement Task(s):
            My second goal was to enhance my web development skills by working on projects using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Laravel. I set weekly goals to complete tasks such as building web pages and integrating databases while learning new tools like React.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2"> Career Planning:
            My goal was to improve my web development skills by building a dynamic web application during my co-op placement. I focused on learning technologies like Laravel, React, and database integration, dedicating time outside of school to practice. By completing a project, such as an e-commerce site or portfolio, I tracked my progress and enhanced my professional growth in the software industry.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Middle of Semester</h3>
          <p class="mt-2"> Employability
            I worked on improving my initiative and communication skills during my online co-op placement. I regularly scheduled check-ins with my supervisor to clarify tasks and provided outlines before creating demos. I tracked how often my work aligned with expectations and aimed to reduce miscommunications, ultimately improving task efficiency through feedback from my supervisor.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2"> Placement Task(s):
            I focused on enhancing my front-end development skills with Tailwind CSS. While my main role was back-end development, I designed web pages more efficiently, completing at least three pages in four weeks and reducing design time by 30%. I practiced Tailwind CSS outside of assigned tasks and received feedback to track my progress.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2"> Career Planning:
            I aimed to learn more about software development for event-planning applications, particularly prom-planning software. I engaged with my supervisor, reviewed documentation, and participated in code reviews. By mid-December, I contributed to features like scheduling and guest management, receiving positive feedback that enhanced my problem-solving and coding skills for future tech roles.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600">Then</h3>
        <p class="mt-4">At the start of the semester, I was nervous about my placement. Although I had worked on a project over the summer, I lacked confidence in my abilities and feared making mistakes that would cause problems for my supervisor. I struggled with time management, which slowed my progress. I was intimidated by my supervisor, unsure if my work would meet company standards. My skills with the Laravel framework were still basic, and I had no experience with Tailwind CSS, a frontend framework that was important for the role.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600">Now</h3>
        <p class="mt-4">After this experience, I've gained confidence in handling Laravel projects. I've improved my time management skills, and my work output has become more efficient. I'm more confident in my abilities and have developed a good relationship with my supervisor, who provides constructive feedback. My Laravel skills have improved significantly, and I now work on personal projects for fun. Additionally, I’ve boosted my frontend skills (One of my CELP goals), including learning Tailwind CSS and applying it in this project.</p>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600">Personal Growth</h3>
        <p class="mt-4">Throughout this semester, I was able to personally grow by improving my problem-solving, communication and independence. 
          Due to my placement being completely remote, I had no one actually directly supervising me in the workplace meaning I had to hold myself accountable in order to get work done. 
          In the beginning I struggled with this as I had full unrestricted access to the internet. To fix this issue as mentioned in my CELP goals, I wanted to work on my self-regulation. 
          As the semester progressed by sticking to my celp goals, I was able to be much more productive.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600">Professional Growth</h3>
        <p class="mt-4">I have significantly enhanced both my technical and soft skills, particularly in Tailwind CSS and Laravel, which has made me more employable and better prepared for future career opportunities. Additionally, I developed valuable workplace skills that are transferable to any career. For example, I learned the importance of clear communication and taking initiative. Without effectively communicating with my supervisor about the application I was developing, progress could have been delayed, as misunderstandings might have required me to restart my work. </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-center mb-8">Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p class="text-center max-w-2xl mx-auto">
      I learned that I am capable of more than I initially believed. By setting clear goals and actively seeking feedback, I overcame challenges and achieved milestones I never thought possible. This experience has taught me not only about computer science but the importance of independence, perseverance and discipline.
