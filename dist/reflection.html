            Employability: My first goal was to improve self-regulation and focus during my online co-op placement. To minimize distractions, I used a structured schedule, productivity tools, aiming to reduce distractions by 50% within four weeks.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2"> Placement Task(s):
            My second goal was to enhance my web development skills by working on projects using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Laravel. I set weekly goals to complete tasks such as building web pages and integrating databases while learning new tools like React.
          </p>
          <p> Career Planning:
            My goal was to improve my web development skills by building a dynamic web application during my co-op placement. I focused on learning technologies like Laravel, React, and database integration, dedicating time outside of school to practice. By completing a project, such as an e-commerce site or portfolio, I tracked my progress and enhanced my professional growth in the software industry.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Middle of Semester</h3>
          <p class="mt-2"> Employability
            I worked on improving my initiative and communication skills during my online co-op placement. I regularly scheduled check-ins with my supervisor to clarify tasks and provided outlines before creating demos. I tracked how often my work aligned with expectations and aimed to reduce miscommunications, ultimately improving task efficiency through feedback from my supervisor.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2"> Placement Task(s):
            I focused on enhancing my front-end development skills with Tailwind CSS. While my main role was back-end development, I designed web pages more efficiently, completing at least three pages in four weeks and reducing design time by 30%. I practiced Tailwind CSS outside of assigned tasks and received feedback to track my progress.
          </p>
          <p> Career Planning:
            I aimed to learn more about software development for event-planning applications, particularly prom-planning software. I engaged with my supervisor, reviewed documentation, and participated in code reviews. By mid-December, I contributed to features like scheduling and guest management, receiving positive feedback that enhanced my problem-solving and coding skills for future tech roles.
