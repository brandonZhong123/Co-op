    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">Future Pathway</h2>
    <p class="text-lg">
      If I decide to pursue a career in computer science, my journey begins with completing secondary school, Where I plan on developing the projects listed above. I have already finished all possible high school computer science courses so they only thing I can do in highschool is particpate in contests and make projects.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      After high school, I plan to pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science or software engineering. I plan to apply to UofT's or waterloos 4-5 year co-op program if I. During my post-secondary education, I will prioritize hands-on experience by participating in co-op placements or internships to work directly with companies in the tech industry. This will not only deepen my technical skills but also provide insight into workplace dynamics and expectations.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      While I currently do not foresee pursuing graduate school, I am open to the possibility if it aligns with my career aspirations. For example, pursuing a master’s degree in areas like artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, or data science could enhance my specialization and career prospects, especially if I aim to take on leadership roles or explore advanced research opportunities.

    <p class="text-lg">
      My future plan with computer science is not completely what I want to pursue as I don't have a crazy passion to do this for the rest of my life. Computer science, to me, is still a fun and interesting field that allows me to explore creative problem-solving and build innovative solutions. While I may not see myself dedicating my entire career to it, I value the skills and experiences it provides, which can be applied to a wide range of industries and roles.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      For now, I aim to gain as much knowledge and experience as possible in computer science, as it offers a strong foundation and opens doors to many exciting opportunities. While I may not see myself working exclusively in this field forever, I’m confident that the skills I acquire will help me make meaningful contributions, no matter where my career ultimately takes me.
