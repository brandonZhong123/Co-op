    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">Career Insights and Goals</h2>
    <p class="text-lg">
      From my research and experiences, I’ve learned that a career in web development requires a blend of technical expertise, creativity, and adaptability. The tech industry evolves rapidly, so staying ahead involves continuous learning through certifications, online courses, and practical experience. I also recognize the importance of building a strong professional network, which I plan to achieve by attending hackathons, industry events, and joining online developer communities.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      My ultimate career goal in computer science is to become a full-stack web developer, creating applications that address real-world challenges. In the long term, I aspire to work on projects that make a difference in fields like education, healthcare, or community development. By combining technical proficiency with an understanding of user needs, I aim to create impactful, innovative, and user-centric solutions.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Whether through entrepreneurship, working with a forward-thinking tech company, or contributing to open-source initiatives, my vision is to be a lifelong learner and a proactive problem-solver in the ever-evolving field of technology. By consistently setting and achieving incremental goals, I am confident in my ability to reach my ultimate aspiration of contributing to meaningful projects that improve lives and empower communities.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">Conclusion </h2>
    <p class="text-lg">
      My future plan with computer science is not completely what I want to pursue as I don't have a crazy passion to do this for the rest of my life. Computer science, to me, is still a fun and interesting field that allows me to explore creative problem-solving and build innovative solutions. I also might want to pursue Artificial intelligence in computer science instead of web development. While I may not see myself dedicating my entire career to it, I value the skills and experiences it provides, which can be applied to a wide range of industries and roles.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      For now, I aim to gain as much knowledge and experience as possible in computer science, as it offers a strong foundation and opens doors to many exciting opportunities. While I may not see myself working exclusively in this field forever, I’m confident that the skills I acquire will help me make meaningful contributions, no matter where my career ultimately takes me.
